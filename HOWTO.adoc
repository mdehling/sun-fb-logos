= HOWTO Dump SUN Device Firmware
Malte Dehling <mdehling@gmail.com>


The goal of this document is to describe a simple way of reading the FCode
(firmware) on SUN expansion cards of various types.  For SBUS cards, the
easiest way to do this is if you're running SunOS / Solaris.  For other bus
types and for SBUS in case you are not running SunOS / Solaris, a convenient
way is to read the firmware from the OpenBoot `ok` prompt.  To capture the
data, you will need to set up a serial connection and enable logging.
Unplugging the keyboard should make ttya the console.  Then, on Linux / Unix /
MacOS simply run `script` in a terminal and connect using `cu -l /dev/ttyUSB0`
or `tip hardwire` or such.  To end the `script` session simply type `<Ctrl>+d`;
this should leave you with a log file of your session called `typescript`.  On
Windows you could use Putty and enable logging in the settings.

If you have any issues following these instructions, do not hesitate to contact

SBUS Cards
----------
If you're running SunOS / Solaris, you can simply read the PROM from a
character device using dd as follows (as root.)

----
# dd if=sbusX-device bs=1k count=32 of=/tmp/sbusX.bin
----

On SunOS 4.x / Solaris 1.x the device name is `/dev/sbusX`, on SunOS 5.x /
Solaris 2.x it is `/devices/sbus*/sbusmem@X,0:slotX` or
`/devices/iommu*/sbus*/sbusmem@X,0:slotX`, depending on the machine type
(kernel architeture.)

Another way to read the PROM contents is from the OpenBoot prompt.  Assuming
OpenBoot 2.x with new style `ok` prompt, navigate the device tree to the
relevant device, map its memory, and dump the contents.  For a cgsix card in
SBUS slot 1 of a sun4m machine this would look as follows:

At the `More` prompt, answer `c` to continue the rest of the dump without
interruption.

In older OBP versions the `dump` command doesn't have the `c` option which
makes it useless for dumping large amounts of data.  In that case, use the
following instead to dump the PROM one byte per line: (You could use other
ways, too, but this one is the easiest for me as I've already written the
conversion program to turn in into a binary.)

To find your device in the device tree, you can navigate it (almost) as if it
were a unix system, e.g., use `cd /`, `ls`, `cd iommu`, `pwd`, etc.  You do not
need to type the part after the `@` symbol if it is unique.

NOTE: The first approach does not work for onboard SBUS devices while the
second does!


UPA Cards
---------
UPA devices live in the root of the device tree, at least on the systems I have
access to.  Simply do `cd /` followed by `ls` to locate your device.  Now go to
your device, use `.properties` (or `.attributes` on OBP 2.x) to find its
address, map its memory, and finally dump the contents.  For a Creator 3D in an
Ultra 60 this is done as follows:

----
ok cd /SUNW,ffb
ok .properties
[...]

The first three numbers in the `map-in` line should match the ones in the first
line of the `reg` property in reverse order.

Again, answer `c` at the `More` prompt to continue dumping the PROM without
interruption.  This will take a while (possibly several minutes) and the
resulting log file should be around 2.5MB in size.  The reason is that only
every fourth byte is actually relevant data for some reason.


PCI(e) Cards
------------
The process for PCI(e) devices is very similar to that for UPA devices, except
that access to the firmware needs to be enabled first by writing to the
configuration memory.  Begin by locating your device as before, and use
`.properties` to show its `reg` property.  This property has two relevant
lines: the first starts and ends with `00` (configuration), the other's first
number starts with `02` and ends in `30` (expansion.)

----
ok cd /pci/SUNW,XVR-100
ok .properties
[...]
reg                      00800800 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
                         ^^^^^^^^
                         02800830 00000000 00000000 00000000 00020000
                         ^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^          ^^^^^^^^
[...]
----

Select the parent node of the PCI(e) card in question, i.e. `/pci` in this
case, and use the first number from the configuration line to enable firmware
access:

----
ok " /pci" select-dev
ok 800800 4 + dup config-w@ 2 or swap config-w!
ok 800800 30 + dup config-l@ 1 or swap config-l!
----

Next, use the first three numbers from the expansion line (in reverse order)
and the last number to map in the firmware.  Use the `dump` command to dump the
firmware as before.

More [<space>,<cr>,q,n,p,c] ?

At the `More` prompt, answer `c` to continue without further interruptions.
This should transfer roughly 600KB of data, so it might take a little bit
depending on your baud rate.
